Small project that was done for Visual Concepts interview. The full details are in the prompt PDF, but the long and short of it is the following:

Given an adjacency matrix defining time to travel to all other cities for n cities, this program finds the quickest amount of time that all cities can be travelled to from starting city. 
Each row of the matrix represents a city and the columns represent time taken to all other cities. The program finds the shortest time taken by utilizing Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm.
